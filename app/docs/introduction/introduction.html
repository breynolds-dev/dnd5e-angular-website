    <p>There are a few things of note before we begin:</p>
    <p><i class="tiny material-icons">info</i> This API is <strong>consumption-only</strong>, thus the only HTTP method we accept is a GET request.<br /></p>
    <p><i class="tiny material-icons">info</i> There is <strong>No Authentication</strong> at this time.  This is free for public use and consumption, be aware that this could change in the future as our server loads increase<br /></p>

    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="divider"></div>
    </div>
    <p>At this time we do not have any wrappers for our API.  If you would like to create one we would love to see it and get it added here!</p>

    <p>There are several different instances where an API response will contain information from another resource or several other resources.  These should be represented as a CollectionResource or as a CommonResource.</p>
    <p>A <strong>CollectionResource</strong> will contain information about an associated model, ie: A Race will have a CollectionResource of languages.  This should contain the basic information that will be important for that response as well as a url to the associated information's endpoint for more detail.</p>
    <p>A <strong>CommonResource</strong> will contain information that has a commonality between all resources.  This typically will be a collection of links to every associated resource in the response.</p>
